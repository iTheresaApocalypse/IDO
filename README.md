This repository is the official implementation of the paper "[Handling Label Noise via Instance-Level Difficulty
Modeling and Dynamic Optimization]". It includes complete training, validation, and inference pipelines.

## 📌 Overview

![Overview](J:\IDO\Overview.png)We propose IDO, an Instance-level Difficulty Modeling and Dynamic Optimization framework to achieve robust learning over noisy training data. Rather than relying on hyperparameters to regularize different terms in the loss function, IDO designs a dynamically weighted loss function that captures both the cleanliness and difficulty of each individual sample.
This enables instance-level optimization without introducing any additional hyperparameter.

## 🚀 Key Features

- A simple but robust metric - wrong event
- A dynamic loss function considering clean, hard and noise information
- A two-stage framework using pre-trained models to handle noisy labels

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

```
conda create -n IDO python=3.8
conda activate IDO
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```
Data Preparation
Download cifar100, tiny-imagenet, cifar100-N, clothing1m, webvision.
```

Extract files to './data/' directory (create if missing).

### Running Py Files 

Stage 1 Training

```
# real-world dataset
python stage_1.py --config 'config/stage1/[dataset].yaml' 
# synthetic dataset
python stage_1.py --config 'config/stage1/[dataset].yaml' --noise_mode ['sym' 'asym' 'idn'] --noise_ratio [0,1]
```

Stage 2 Training

```
# real-world dataset
python stage_2.py --config 'config/stage2/[dataset].yaml' 
# synthetic dataset
python stage_2.py --config 'config/stage2/[dataset].yaml' --noise_mode ['sym' 'asym' 'idn'] --noise_ratio [0,1]
```

### Running sh Files

```
sh sh/[cifar100.sh, tiny_imagenet.sh,realworld.sh]
```

### Procedure Document

1. After finishing stage 1, the wrong event information and a bar chart will be stored into './stage1'.
2. After finishing stage 1, a competitive base model will be stored into './base_model'.
3. After finishing stage 2, the best accuracy will be stored into './stage2'.
4. The training log files will be stored into './checkpoint'.
