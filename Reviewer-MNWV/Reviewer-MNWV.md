### Table 1

| Method    | Architecture | AccuracyÂ±std   | Time per Epoch |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| DivideMix | ResNet-50    | 74.59Â±0.55     | 717s           |
| IDO       | ResNet-50    | **74.77Â±0.48** | **229s**       |

<center>Table 1. The results of DivideMix and IDO. The experiment is conducted under the setting with pre-trained ResNet50, with SGD, lr = 2e-3, weight_decay = 1e-3, momentum=0.9, batch_size=64. One epoch has 1000 iterations, and 100 epochs are trained. We set stage 1 for 2 epochs, stage 2 for 98 epochs. The experiment was performed on a single A100 80GB, repeated 5 times</center>
